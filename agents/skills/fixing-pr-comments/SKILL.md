# Fixing PR Comments

Address PR review comments: assess validity, make changes, reply to each thread.

**Process**: Fetch comments → Assess each → Plan edits → Edit code → Commit → Push → Update PR → Reply to all

## Workflow

### 1. Fetch PR and Comments

```bash
scripts/fetch_comments.sh <pr_url_or_number>
```

Returns JSON with:
- `info` — PR metadata (title, branch, head SHA)
- `review_comments` — Inline comments on code (have file path + line)
- `issue_comments` — General PR discussion

### 2. Assess Each Comment

Categorize before acting. See [references/reply-templates.md](references/reply-templates.md) for examples.

| Assessment | Action | Reply |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Valid & actionable | Make change | Confirm what changed |
| Valid, disagree | No change | Technical rationale |
| Invalid / N/A | No change | Explain why |
| Unclear | No change | Ask clarifying question |

**Skip threads where an agent already replied** (look for `[🤖` prefix) unless someone followed up after.

### 3. Plan All Changes

List changes BEFORE editing — line numbers shift after edits.

For each comment requiring code changes:
1. Note file path and line number (`line` field = line in PR head branch)
2. Read the file to understand context
3. Plan the specific edit

### 4. Edit Code and Commit

Make all planned edits, then:

```bash
git add <specific-files>
git commit -m "Address PR review comments"
```

### 5. Push Changes

```bash
git push
```

### 6. Update PR Description

```bash
scripts/update_pr_description.py <<'EOF'
{"pr": "123", "summary": "- Fixed X\n- Added Y"}
EOF
```

Keep summary brief — one line per change made.

### 7. Reply to Each Thread

For review comments (inline on code):
```bash
scripts/post_reply.py <<'EOF'
{"pr": "123", "comment_id": 456, "name": "Claude", "body": "Your reply"}
EOF
```

For issue comments (general discussion):
```bash
scripts/post_reply.py <<'EOF'
{"pr": "123", "issue_comment_id": 789, "name": "Claude", "body": "Your reply"}
EOF
```

The script:
- Adds `[🤖 {name}]:` prefix automatically
- Prevents double-replies (add `"force": true` to override)

## Rules

- **Reply to ALL comments** — every thread gets a response
- **Push before replying** — ensures code changes are visible when reviewer reads reply
- **Plan before editing** — avoids line number drift issues
- **Never skip unclear comments** — ask for clarification instead
