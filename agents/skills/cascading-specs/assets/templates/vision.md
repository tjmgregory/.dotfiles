# Vision

> **Reminder**: Goals are measurable outcomes, not features. "Reduce support tickets by 40%" not "Build a chatbot."

## Problem Statement

<!--
Be concrete and stakeholder-focused. Answer:
- What problem exists?
- Who has this problem?
- How do we know it's a problem? (Measurable evidence)

Example:
"Customer support agents spend 60% of their time answering repetitive questions
that could be automated. This results in 2-hour average response times and
$50,000/month in staffing costs for low-value interactions."
-->

## Solution Overview

<!--
High-level conceptual approach. NOT a feature list.

Example:
"An AI-powered self-service system that enables customers to resolve common
issues independently, with seamless escalation to human agents when needed."

NOT: "A chatbot with NLP, a knowledge base, ticket integration, and analytics dashboard."
-->

## Goals

<!--
Each goal should be:
- Measurable (you can tell if achieved)
- Outcome-focused (what changes in the world)
- Stable (won't change based on implementation details)
-->

| ID | Goal | Success Criteria |
|----|------|------------------|
| G-001 | | |
| G-002 | | |

<!--
Good examples:
| G-001 | Reduce customer support response time | Average response time < 5 minutes (from 2 hours) |
| G-002 | Decrease support staffing costs | 40% reduction in agent hours for routine queries |
| G-003 | Improve customer satisfaction | NPS score increases from 32 to 50 |

Bad examples:
| G-001 | Build a chatbot | Chatbot is deployed | ← Describes solution, not outcome
| G-002 | Improve efficiency | Things work better | ← Not measurable
-->

## Non-Goals

<!--
What is explicitly OUT of scope? This prevents scope creep.
List things stakeholders might reasonably expect that you're deliberately NOT building.

Examples:
- Enterprise deployment (this serves teams < 50 users)
- Multi-language support (English only for v1)
- Mobile app (web-only initially)
- Integration with legacy CRM system
-->

-

## Target Users

<!--
Who will use this system? Be specific about:
- Primary users (main beneficiaries)
- Secondary users (occasional or administrative users)
- Key characteristics that affect design

Example:
**Primary**: Customers seeking support (non-technical, impatient, often frustrated)
**Secondary**: Support agents (handle escalations, maintain knowledge base)
**Admin**: Support managers (review analytics, configure system)
-->

## Success Metrics

<!--
Business outcomes that indicate the system is working.
These should be BUSINESS metrics, not technical ones.

Good: "Revenue increases 20%", "Support tickets decrease 40%"
Bad: "99.9% uptime", "Response time < 200ms" (these are NFRs, not success metrics)

Examples:
- Customer self-service resolution rate > 60%
- Support ticket volume decreases by 40% within 3 months
- Customer satisfaction score improves by 15 points
-->

## Key Constraints

<!--
Limitations that bound the solution space:
- Timeline constraints
- Budget constraints
- Technical constraints (must integrate with X, must run on Y)
- Regulatory constraints (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- Organisational constraints (team skills, existing systems)

Examples:
- Must launch within Q2 (3 months)
- Budget: $100,000 including infrastructure
- Must integrate with existing Zendesk instance
- Must comply with GDPR (EU customers)
- Team has no ML expertise (prefer managed AI services)
