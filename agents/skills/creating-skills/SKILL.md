## About Skills

Skills are filesystem-based packages that provide Claude with domain-specific capabilities. Each skill is a directory containing:

- **SKILL.md** (required) - YAML frontmatter (name + description) plus markdown instructions
- **Bundled resources** (optional) - Scripts, references, and assets

**Progressive loading**: Skills load in stages to minimize context usage:
1. **Metadata** - Name and description always in system prompt (~100 tokens per skill)
2. **SKILL.md body** - Loaded only when skill triggers
3. **Bundled resources** - Loaded only as needed by Claude

This means many skills can be installed without context penalty.

## Core Principles

### Concise is Key

The context window is a public good. Skills share it with the system prompt, conversation history, other skills' metadata, and the user's request.

**Default assumption: Claude is already very smart.** Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: "Does Claude really need this explanation?" and "Does this paragraph justify its token cost?"

Prefer concise examples over verbose explanations.

### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom

Match the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:

**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.

**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.

**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.

Think of Claude as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).

### Anatomy of a Skill

Every skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)
│   │   ├── name: (required)
│   │   └── description: (required)
│   └── Markdown instructions (required)
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)
    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed
    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)
```

#### SKILL.md (required)

Every SKILL.md consists of:

- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Claude reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.
- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).

#### Bundled Resources (optional)

##### Scripts (`scripts/`)

Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.

- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed
- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks
- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context
- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments

##### References (`references/`)

Documentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.

- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working
- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications
- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides
- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed
- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md
- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.

##### Assets (`assets/`)

Files not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.

- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output
- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography
- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified
- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context

#### What to Not Include in a Skill

A skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:

- README.md
- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md
- QUICK_REFERENCE.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- etc.

The skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxiliary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.

### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle

Skills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:

1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)
3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)

#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns

Keep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.

**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files.

**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**

```markdown
# PDF Processing

## Quick start

Extract text with pdfplumber:
[code example]

## Advanced features

- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide
- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods
- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns
```

Claude loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.

**Pattern 2: Conditional details**

Show basic content, link to advanced content:

```markdown
# DOCX Processing

## Creating documents

Use docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).

## Editing documents

For simple edits, modify the XML directly.

**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)
**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)
```

Claude reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.

**Important guidelines:**

- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.
- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so Claude can see the full scope when previewing.

## Best Practices References

Consult these guides for detailed best practices:

- **Writing scripts for skills**: See [references/script-best-practices.md](references/script-best-practices.md) for execution intent, error handling, MCP tool references, and feedback loops
- **Content and terminology**: See [references/content-guidelines.md](references/content-guidelines.md) for time-sensitive info, consistent terminology, file path conventions, and avoiding too many options
- **Testing and evaluation**: See [references/evaluation-guide.md](references/evaluation-guide.md) for evaluation-driven development and multi-model testing
- **Composite skills**: See [references/composite-skills.md](references/composite-skills.md) for skills that reference or hand off to other skills

## Skill Creation Process

Skill creation involves these steps:

1. Understand the skill with concrete examples
2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)
3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)
4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)
5. Iterate based on real usage

Follow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.

## Skill Location & Availability

Skills can live in two places:

| Location | Availability | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `~/.dotfiles/agents/skills/` | All IDEs, all projects | General-purpose skills |
| `<project>/skills/` | IDEs when in that project | Project-specific workflows |

A project skill can be **promoted** to global availability via symlink, keeping the source of truth in the project.

### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples

Skip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.

To create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.

For example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:

- "What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?"
- "Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?"
- "I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?"
- "What would a user say that should trigger this skill?"

To avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.

Conclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.

### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents

To turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:

1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch
2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly
3. Identifying whether any part of the workflow should hand off to another skill (see [references/composite-skills.md](references/composite-skills.md))

Example: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like "Help me rotate this PDF," the analysis shows:

1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time
2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill

Example: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like "Build me a todo app" or "Build me a dashboard to track my steps," the analysis shows:

1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time
2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill

Example: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like "How many users have logged in today?" the analysis shows:

1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time
2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill

To establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.

### Step 3: Initializing the Skill

At this point, it is time to actually create the skill.

Skip this step only if the skill being developed already exists. In this case, continue to the next step.

When creating a new skill from scratch, run the init script. It generates a template skill directory with everything required.

**Requirements**: Python 3.x

**Creating a global skill (available to all IDEs):**

```bash
scripts/init_skill.py <<'EOF'
{"name": "my-skill"}
EOF
```

**Creating a project-local skill:**

```bash
# First, run setup for the project (one-time)
scripts/setup_project_skills.py <<'EOF'
{"path": "/path/to/project"}
EOF

# Then run init with the project path
scripts/init_skill.py <<'EOF'
{"name": "my-skill", "path": "/path/to/project/skills"}
EOF
```

The init script:

- Creates the skill directory
- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders
- Creates example resource directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`
- Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted

After initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed.

### Step 4: Edit the Skill

When editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively.

#### Learn Proven Design Patterns

Consult these reference guides based on your skill's needs:

- **Multi-step processes**: See [references/workflows.md](references/workflows.md) for sequential workflows and conditional logic
- **Output formats**: See [references/output-patterns.md](references/output-patterns.md) for template and example patterns
- **Script best practices**: See [references/script-best-practices.md](references/script-best-practices.md) for error handling, execution intent, and MCP tools
- **Content guidelines**: See [references/content-guidelines.md](references/content-guidelines.md) for terminology, file paths, and avoiding pitfalls
- **Testing and evaluation**: See [references/evaluation-guide.md](references/evaluation-guide.md) for evaluation-driven development
- **Composite skills**: See [references/composite-skills.md](references/composite-skills.md) for referencing other skills without leaking their implementation

#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents

To begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.

Added scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.

Any example files and directories not needed for the skill should be deleted. The initialization script creates example files in `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them.

#### Update SKILL.md

**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.

##### Frontmatter

Write the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:

**name** (max 64 characters):
- Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- Prefer gerund form (verb + -ing): `processing-pdfs`, `analyzing-spreadsheets`, `creating-skills`
- Acceptable alternatives: noun phrases (`pdf-processing`) or action-oriented (`process-pdfs`)
- Avoid vague names (`helper`, `utils`), overly generic (`documents`, `data`), or reserved words (`anthropic`, `claude`)

**description** (max 1024 characters):
- **Always write in third person** - The description is injected into the system prompt, and inconsistent point-of-view causes discovery problems.
  - **Good**: "Processes Excel files and generates reports"
  - **Avoid**: "I can help you process Excel files"
  - **Avoid**: "This skill should be used when..."
- Include both what the skill does AND specific triggers for when to use it
- Include all "when to use" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering.
- Example: "Extracts text and tables from PDF files, fills forms, merges documents. Use when working with PDF files or when user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction."

Do not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.

##### Body

Write instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.

### Step 5: Iterate

After completing the skill, test it on real tasks. Users may request improvements based on how the skill performs.

**Iteration workflow:**

1. Use the skill on real tasks
2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies
3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated
4. Implement changes and test again

For detailed guidance on testing and evaluation, see [references/evaluation-guide.md](references/evaluation-guide.md).

## Additional Operations

### Promoting a Project Skill to Global

If a project-local skill should be available everywhere:

```bash
scripts/promote_skill.py <<'EOF'
{"path": "/path/to/project/skills/my-skill"}
EOF
```

This creates a symlink in `~/.dotfiles/agents/skills/` pointing to the project skill.

### Packaging for External Distribution

To share a skill with others outside your setup:

```bash
scripts/package_skill.py <<'EOF'
{"path": "/path/to/skill-folder"}
EOF
```
