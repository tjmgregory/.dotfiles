Solution: Check your API key format:

Set environment variable:

Error: Not a tar.gz file: react.zip

Solution: Use correct —target flag:

Check API key is valid:

Check target matches:

Q: Can I use the same scraped data for all platforms?

A: Yes! The scraping phase is universal. Only packaging and upload are platform-specific.

Q: Do I need separate API keys for each platform?

A: Yes, each platform requires its own API key. Set them as environment variables.

Q: Can I enhance with different models?

A: Yes, each platform uses its own enhancement model:

Q: What if I don’t want to upload automatically?

A: Use the package command without upload. You’ll get the packaged file to upload manually.

Q: Is the markdown export compatible with all LLMs?

A: Yes! The generic markdown export creates universal documentation that works with any LLM or documentation system.

The Three-Stream Architecture is a revolutionary approach to analyzing GitHub repositories that splits them into three distinct streams: Code, Documentation, and Insights. This provides Claude AI with a complete understanding of any framework or library.

Instead of treating a GitHub repository as a single monolithic source, Skill Seekers now intelligently splits it into three separate streams:

Deep C3.x analysis of the actual codebase:

Time: 20-60 minutes (depending on repo size)

Official documentation from the repository:

Community knowledge from GitHub:

Before (single stream):

After (three streams):

The architecture automatically detects when documentation and code disagree:

Skill Seekers creates hybrid content showing BOTH versions with warnings.

From GitHub issues, Claude learns:

Use for: Quick overview, testing, small projects

Use for: Production skills, comprehensive understanding

Combine documentation websites WITH GitHub analysis:

You get 4 data sources:

With three streams, skills become router-based for better organization:

Analyzing https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp:

Works with local paths too (no GitHub metadata):

The Three-Stream Architecture has:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
GitHub Repository
  ↓
Three-Stream Fetcher
  ├─ Stream 1: CODE → C3.x Analysis (patterns, examples)
  ├─ Stream 2: DOCS → README/docs/*.md (official docs)
  └─ Stream 3: INSIGHTS → Common problems + solutions
```

Example 2 (lua):
```lua
# Documentation says:
GoogleProvider(app_id="...", app_secret="...")

# But code actually uses:
GoogleProvider(client_id="...", client_secret="...")
```

Example 3 (markdown):
```markdown
# Analyze a GitHub repo with all three streams
skill-seekers unified \
  --repo-url https://github.com/facebook/react \
  --depth c3x \
  --fetch-github-metadata \
  --output-dir output/react
```

Example 4 (json):
```json
{
  "name": "react",
  "description": "React framework with complete GitHub analysis",
  "sources": [
    {
      "type": "codebase",
      "source": "https://github.com/facebook/react",

C3.x is Skill Seekers’ deep codebase analysis system that uses Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing to extract comprehensive knowledge from source code. It goes far beyond simple scraping to understand how code actually works.

C3.x stands for Comprehensive Codebase Context Extraction with 7 analysis modules:

C3.x analyzes code through AST parsing for:

Automatically detects common design patterns in your codebase.

From analyzing fastmcp repository:

Extracts working code examples from test files.

From fastmcp repository:

Generates step-by-step tutorials from code patterns.

Analyzes configuration files to understand setup patterns.

Automatically scans for:

Identifies high-level architecture patterns.

Enable only specific modules:

C3.x uses intelligent caching:

After C3.x analysis, you can enhance with AI:

Use basic mode instead:

Time: 1-2 minutes Gets: File structure, imports, entry points (no C3.x)

**Examples:**

Example 1 (json):
```json
{
  "pattern": "Strategy",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "location": "src/providers/oauth_provider.py",
  "line_number": 42,
  "context": {

}
```

Example 2 (json):
```json
{
  "title": "OAuth with Google Provider",
  "source": "tests/test_oauth.py:23-45",
  "language": "python",
  "code": "def test_google_oauth():\n    provider = GoogleProvider(\n        client_id='test-id',\n        client_secret='test-secret',\n        redirect_uri='http://localhost:8000/callback'\n    )\n    \n    auth_url = provider.get_authorization_url()\n    assert 'accounts.google.com' in auth_url",

Example 3 (markdown):
```markdown
# How to Implement OAuth Authentication

## Overview
This guide shows how to add OAuth authentication using the Strategy pattern.

## Prerequisites
- Provider credentials (client_id, client_secret)
- Redirect URI configured

## Step 1: Create Provider Instance
\`\`\`python
from fastmcp import GoogleProvider

provider = GoogleProvider(
    client_id="your-client-id",
    client_secret="your-secret",
    redirect_uri="http://localhost:8000/callback"
)
\`\`\`

## Step 2: Generate Authorization URL
\`\`\`python
auth_url = provider.get_authorization_url()
# Redirect user to auth_url
\`\`\`

## Step 3: Handle Callback
\`\`\`python
token = provider.exchange_code(request.params['code'])
user_info = provider.get_user_info(token)
\`\`\`

## Common Issues
- **Redirect URI mismatch:** Ensure URI matches exactly in provider console
- **Invalid credentials:** Double-check client_id and client_secret
```

## Unified Multi-Source Scraping | Skill Seekers Docs

Version: 2.0 (Feature complete as of October 2025)

Unified multi-source scraping allows you to combine knowledge from multiple sources into a single comprehensive Claude skill. Instead of choosing between documentation, GitHub repositories, or PDF manuals, you can now extract and intelligently merge information from all of them.

The Problem: Documentation and code often drift apart over time. Official docs might be outdated, missing features that exist in code, or documenting features that have been removed. Separately scraping docs and code creates two incomplete skills.

The Solution: Unified scraping:

Create a config file with multiple sources:

The unified scraper automatically detects 4 types of conflicts:

Severity: Medium Description: API exists in code but is not documented

Suggestion: Add documentation for this API

Severity: High Description: API is documented but not found in codebase

Suggestion: Update documentation to remove this API, or add it to codebase

Severity: Medium-High Description: API exists in both but signatures differ

Suggestion: Update documentation to match actual signature

Severity: Low Description: Different descriptions/docstrings

Fast, deterministic merging using predefined rules:

AI-powered reconciliation using local Claude Code:

The unified scraper creates this structure:

useEffect(callback: () => void, deps: any[])

useEffect(callback: () => void | (() => void), deps?: readonly any[])

The unified scraper is fully integrated with MCP. The scrape_docs tool automatically detects unified vs legacy configs and routes to the appropriate scraper.

Legacy configs still work! The system automatically detects legacy single-source configs and routes to the original doc_scraper.py.

Rule-based is fast and works well for most cases. Only use Claude-enhanced if you need human oversight.

code_analysis_depth: "surface" is usually sufficient. Deep analysis is expensive and rarely needed.

max_issues: 100 is a good default. More than 200 issues rarely adds value.

Always review references/conflicts.md to understand discrepancies between sources.

Solution: Ensure both sources have API extraction enabled

Solution: Review conflicts manually and adjust merge strategy

v2.0 (October 2025): Unified multi-source scraping feature complete

**Examples:**

Example 1 (json):
```json
{
  "name": "react",
  "description": "Complete React knowledge from docs + codebase",
  "merge_mode": "rule-based",
  "sources": [
    {
      "type": "documentation",
      "base_url": "https://react.dev/",
      "extract_api": true,
      "max_pages": 200
    },
    {
      "type": "github",
      "repo": "facebook/react",
      "include_code": true,
      "code_analysis_depth": "surface",
      "max_issues": 100
    }
  ]
}
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
skill-seekers unified --config configs/react_unified.json
```

Example 3 (go):
```go
skill-seekers package output/react/
```

Transform basic SKILL.md files into comprehensive, production-quality documentation using AI enhancement.

The Problem: Auto-generated SKILL.md files are often too generic:

The Solution: Let Claude analyze your reference documentation and create enhanced SKILL.md with:

Uses your Claude Code Max subscription - no API costs!

Time: 30-60 seconds per skill

Uses Anthropic API directly (~$0.15-$0.30 per skill):

Skill Seekers supports 4 enhancement modes for different workflows:

Best for: CI/CD pipelines, automation scripts

Best for: When you want to continue working

Best for: Long-running tasks that must survive parent process exit

Best for: Manual work, debugging

Local Mode (Recommended - No API Key):

Model: Claude Sonnet 4 Format: Maintains YAML frontmatter

Model: Gemini 2.0 Flash Format: Converts to plain markdown (no frontmatter) Output: Updates system_instructions.md

Model: GPT-4o Format: Converts to plain text Output: Updates assistant_instructions.txt

Note: Local mode is FREE and only available for Claude AI.

When using --background or --daemon, a status file is created:

Location: {skill_directory}/.enhancement_status.json

What it does: Skips ALL confirmations, auto-answers “yes” to everything

Default behavior: Force mode is ON by default for maximum automation

Default timeout: 600 seconds (10 minutes)

Adjust based on skill size:

What happens on timeout:

Test Case: steam-economy skill

The enhancement successfully:

Enhancement creates these files:

“claude command not found”

“Enhancement timed out”

“SKILL.md was not updated”

Background task not progressing:

Status file shows error:

“No API key provided”

“No reference files found”

“anthropic package not installed”

Don’t like the result?

Use enhancement when:

Skip enhancement when:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (markdown):
```markdown
# Basic enhancement
skill-seekers enhance output/react/

# With custom timeout
skill-seekers enhance output/react/ --timeout 1200

# Background mode (non-blocking)
skill-seekers enhance output/react/ --background

# Daemon mode (survives terminal close)
skill-seekers enhance output/react/ --daemon
```

Example 2 (lua):
```lua
# Install dependencies
pip install anthropic

# Set API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Enhance
skill-seekers enhance output/react/ --mode api
```

Example 3 (markdown):
```markdown
# Runs in foreground, waits for completion
skill-seekers enhance output/react/

# With force mode (no confirmations)
skill-seekers enhance output/react/ --force
```

Example 4 (markdown):

Feature: C3.1 - Detect common design patterns in codebases Version: 2.6.0+ Status: Production Ready ✅

The pattern detection feature automatically identifies common design patterns in your codebase across 9 programming languages. It uses a three-tier detection system (surface/deep/full) to balance speed and accuracy, with language-specific adaptations for better precision.

The --detect-patterns flag integrates with codebase analysis:

Output: output/codebase/patterns/detected_patterns.json

For Claude Code and other MCP clients:

Language-Specific Adaptations:

Tested on 100 real-world Python projects with manually labeled patterns:

False Positives (~13%):

False Negatives (~20%):

Language Limitations:

Pattern detection results will enhance API documentation:

Combine pattern detection with dependency analysis:

Problem: Analysis completes but finds no patterns

Problem: Patterns detected with confidence <0.5

Problem: Analysis takes too long on large codebases

Status: ✅ Production Ready (v2.6.0+) Next: Start using pattern detection to understand and improve your codebase!

Transform test workflows into step-by-step educational guides

The How-To Guide Builder automatically generates comprehensive, step-by-step tutorials from workflow examples extracted from test files. It analyzes test code, identifies sequential steps, detects prerequisites, and creates markdown guides with verification points and troubleshooting tips.

Part of C3 Codebase Enhancement Series:

First, extract workflow examples from your test files:

Generate guides from extracted workflow examples:

Enable guide generation during codebase analysis:

Transform basic guides (⭐⭐) into professional tutorials (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐) with comprehensive AI-powered improvements.

The AI Enhancement system provides 5 automatic improvements that dramatically increase guide quality:

Natural language explanations for each step - not just syntax!

Explanation: Initialize the scraper with the target URL. This configures the HTTP client, sets up request headers, and prepares the URL queue for BFS traversal. The scraper will respect rate limits and follow the URL patterns defined in your configuration.

Use Claude API directly (requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY):

Use Claude Code CLI (no API key needed):

Generate basic guides without AI:

Uses AI analysis from C3.6 enhancement to intelligently group related workflows.

Best for: Maximum quality, logical topic organization

Groups workflows by test file location.

Best for: Small projects, file-based organization

Groups workflows by test name prefixes.

Best for: Consistent test naming conventions

Groups workflows by difficulty level.

Best for: Educational content, progressive learning paths

Each generated guide includes:

Brief description of what the guide teaches and when to use it.

Full working code combining all steps

Common issues and solutions (when available).

Related guides or advanced topics.

The index provides an overview of all guides:

How-to guides are built from workflow examples extracted by C3.2:

AI analysis enhances grouping and explanations:

Generate tutorials for new team members:

Result: Comprehensive guides showing how to use your APIs/libraries based on real test code.

Extract usage patterns from test suites:

Result: Step-by-step API integration guides derived from actual test workflows.

Create progressive learning paths:

Result: Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced progression of tutorials.

Test Set: Skill_Seekers own test suite

Problem: build_guides_from_examples() returns collection with 0 guides

Check input has workflow examples:

Lower quality threshold:

Problem: Generated guides are incomplete or unclear

Enable AI enhancement:

Use better grouping strategy:

Problem: Workflows grouped incorrectly

C3.3 How-To Guide Generation provides:

✅ Automatic tutorial generation from test workflows ✅ 21 comprehensive tests - all passing ✅ 4 intelligent grouping strategies including AI-based ✅ Multi-language support (Python + 8 others) ✅ Rich markdown output with prerequisites, steps, verification ✅ MCP tool integration for Claude Code ✅ Complexity assessment for progressive learning ✅ Complete integration with C3.2 and C3.6

Status: ✅ Implemented in v2.6.0 Issue: #TBD (C3.3) Related Tasks: C3.1 (Pattern Detection), C3.2 (Test Extraction), C3.4-C3.7 (Future enhancements)

**Examples:**

Example 1 (elixir):
```elixir
# Extract test examples including workflows
skill-seekers-codebase tests/ \
  --extract-test-examples \
  --output output/codebase/

# Or use standalone tool
skill-seekers-extract-test-examples tests/ \
  --output output/codebase/test_examples/
```

Example 2 (sql):
```sql
# Build guides from extracted examples
skill-seekers-how-to-guides \
  output/codebase/test_examples/test_examples.json \
  --output output/codebase/tutorials/

# Choose grouping strategy
skill-seekers-how-to-guides examples.json \
  --group-by ai-tutorial-group   # AI-based (default)
  --group-by file-path            # Group by test file
  --group-by test-name            # Group by test name patterns
  --group-by complexity           # Group by difficulty level
```

Example 3 (markdown):
```markdown
# Automatic pipeline: extract tests → build guides
skill-seekers-codebase tests/ \
  --extract-test-examples \
  --build-how-to-guides \
  --output output/codebase/

# Skip guide generation
skill-seekers-codebase tests/ \
  --skip-how-to-guides
```

Example 4 (markdown):
```markdown
### Step 1
```python

Extract content from PDF documentation and convert to AI skills with advanced features including OCR, table extraction, parallel processing, and MCP integration.

Skill Seekers’ PDF scraper converts PDF documentation into AI skills with:

Uses default settings:

Create configs/manual_pdf.json:

Extract text from scanned PDFs using Optical Character Recognition:

Performance: ~2-5 seconds per page

Handle encrypted PDFs:

Security note: Password is passed via command line (visible in process list). For sensitive documents, use environment variables.

Extract tables from PDFs:

Best with: Well-formatted tables, not complex merged cells

Process pages in parallel for 3x faster extraction:

Note: Only activates for PDFs with > 5 pages

Detects chapter boundaries automatically:

Break large PDFs into manageable chunks:

Intelligently merges code blocks split across pages:

Result: Combined into single code block

If PDF has detectable chapters:

Provide custom categories in config:

The scrape_pdf MCP tool provides PDF scraping through Model Context Protocol:

See: MCP Setup for MCP server configuration

Use --from-json for iteration

Problem: Only “content” or “other” category

Problem: Too many poor code examples

Problem: No images in assets/images/

Problem: OCR fails or gives poor results

Problem: Password not accepted

**Examples:**

Example 1 (sql):
```sql
# Extract from PDF
skill-seekers pdf --input manual.pdf --output output/manual/

# With OCR for scanned PDFs
skill-seekers pdf --input scanned.pdf --output output/scanned/ --ocr

# Password-protected PDF
skill-seekers pdf --input encrypted.pdf --password "your-password"

# Extract tables
skill-seekers pdf --input data.pdf --extract-tables

# Parallel processing (3x faster)
skill-seekers pdf --input large.pdf --parallel --workers 8
```

Example 2 (go):
```go
# 1. Extract from PDF
skill-seekers pdf --input manual.pdf --output output/manual/

# 2. Enhance (optional)
skill-seekers enhance output/manual/

# 3. Package
skill-seekers package output/manual/ --target claude

# 4. Upload
skill-seekers upload manual-claude.zip
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
skill-seekers pdf \
  --input manual.pdf \
  --output output/manual/ \
  --extract-images \
  --min-quality 6.0
```
