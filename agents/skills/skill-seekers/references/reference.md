Note: Official Skills API is in development. Manual upload recommended for now.

Future API (planned):

18 tools for skill development:

Restart Claude Desktop to activate MCP tools.

Documentation Scraping:

Skill Management: 5. package_skill - Package skill for platform 6. upload_skill - Upload to Claude/Gemini/OpenAI 7. enhance_skill - AI enhancement 8. validate_skill - Validate skill structure

Codebase Analysis (C3.x): 9. analyze_codebase - Full codebase analysis 10. extract_patterns - Design pattern detection 11. extract_test_examples - Test example extraction 12. build_how_to_guides - Generate tutorials

Git Config Sources: 13. add_git_source - Add git-based config 14. list_git_sources - List sources 15. remove_git_source - Remove source 16. fetch_git_sources - Fetch updates

Utilities: 17. list_presets - Show available presets 18. get_preset - Get preset config

Before uploading to Claude:

Run before packaging:

1. Custom Instructions

2. Sub-Skills (Router Pattern)

Claude AI supports hierarchical skills with intelligent routing.

3. Conversation Context

Skills can access conversation history and maintain context across turns.

Optional metadata file for package info:

Auto-generated during packaging.

Create custom package layouts:

Strategies for scraping and managing documentation sites with 10,000+ pages.

Large documentation sites (10K+ pages) present unique challenges:

Best for: Documentation with clear categorical organization

How it works: Scrape each category into separate sub-skill, create router

Example: Kubernetes Docs

Config example (k8s-concepts.json):

Best for: Unorganized docs or uniform structure

How it works: Auto-split when token budget exceeded

Best for: Pre-planned organization

Speed up scraping with concurrent workers:

Optimal worker count:

Single-process async for moderate speedup:

Resume interrupted scrapes:

Detect and skip already-scraped pages:

Kubernetes Router (4 sub-skills):

Extract only essential content:

Reduce token count by 30-50% by excluding non-essential content.

Skip low-value pages:

Update only changed pages:

Remove duplicate content:

Challenge: Comprehensive docs across 5 major sections

Solution: Category-based split

Challenge: Large, monolithic documentation

Solution: Automatic size-based split

Challenge: Massive internal wiki with poor organization

Solution: Hybrid approach

Factors affecting speed:

Stage 1: Quick scan (get structure)

Stage 2: Analyze and plan split

Stage 3: Full scrape with split

Define custom routing rules:

Symptoms: Process killed, MemoryError

Enable streaming mode:

Split into smaller sub-skills:

Symptoms: Taking 5+ hours for 10K pages

Use parallel workers:

Skip low-value content:

Symptoms: Upload fails, “Token limit exceeded”

Split into router + sub-skills:

Optimize content extraction:

✅ Before scraping, analyze documentation structure:

✅ Clearer organization, better routing ❌ Avoid arbitrary size-based splits if categories exist

✅ Scrape small sample (100 pages) to validate config:

✅ Enable verbose logging:

✅ Always use --checkpoint for large scrapes ✅ Enables resume if interrupted

Status: ✅ Production Ready (v2.0.0+)

Complete guide for architecting complex multi-skill systems using the router/dispatcher pattern.

Claude recommends keeping skill files under 500 lines for optimal performance. This guideline exists because:

As applications grow complex, developers often create skills that:

Skill layering involves:

Result: Build sophisticated applications while maintaining 500-line guideline per skill.

You should split when:

You can keep monolithic when:

A router skill (also called dispatcher or hub skill) is a lightweight master skill that:

Problem: E-commerce skill is 2000+ lines covering catalog, cart, checkout, orders, and admin.

Solution: Split into focused sub-skills with router.

1. ecommerce.md (Router - 150 lines)

2. product_catalog.md (350 lines)

3. shopping_cart.md (280 lines)

Problem: Code assistant handles debugging, refactoring, documentation, testing - 1800+ lines.

Solution: Specialized sub-skills with smart routing.

Problem: ETL pipeline skill covers extraction, transformation, loading, validation, monitoring.

Solution: Pipeline stages as sub-skills.

Each sub-skill should have ONE clear purpose.

❌ Bad: user_management.md handles auth, profiles, permissions, notifications ✅ Good:

Make routing keywords explicit and unambiguous.

❌ Bad: Vague keywords like “data”, “user”, “process” ✅ Good: Specific keywords like “login”, “authenticate”, “extract”, “transform”

Keep router lightweight - just routing logic.

❌ Bad: Router contains actual implementation code ✅ Good: Router only contains:

Group by responsibility, not by code structure.

❌ Bad: Split by file type (controllers, models, views) ✅ Good: Split by feature (user_auth, product_catalog, order_processing)

Don’t create sub-skills for trivial distinctions.

❌ Bad: Separate skills for “add_user” and “update_user” ✅ Good: Single “user_management” skill covering all CRUD

Explicitly state when sub-skills work together.

Use same SKILL.md structure across all sub-skills.

Symptoms: Wrong sub-skill activated or no routing happening

More specific keywords:

Add routing examples:

Check sub-skill descriptions:

Symptoms: Sub-skill exceeds 500 lines

Move reference material:

Symptoms: Router itself is large (> 300 lines)

Simplify routing logic:

Reduce number of sub-skills:

For very large systems:

When to use: Systems with 10+ sub-skills or multiple logical subsystems

Router considers conversation context:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (yaml):
```yaml
User Query: "How do I book a flight to Paris?"
     ↓
Router Skill: Analyzes keywords → "flight", "book"
     ↓
Activates: flight_booking sub-skill
     ↓
Response: Flight booking guidance (only this skill loaded)
```

Example 2 (markdown):
```markdown
# Travel Planner (Router)

## When to Use This Skill

Use for travel planning, booking, and itinerary management.

This is a router skill that directs your questions to specialized sub-skills.

## Sub-Skills Available

### flight_booking
For booking flights, searching airlines, comparing prices, seat selection.
**Keywords:** flight, airline, booking, ticket, departure, arrival

### hotel_reservation
For hotel search, room booking, amenities, check-in/check-out.
**Keywords:** hotel, accommodation, room, reservation, stay

### itinerary_generation
For creating travel plans, scheduling activities, route optimization.
**Keywords:** itinerary, schedule, plan, activities, route

## Routing Logic

Based on your question keywords:
- Flight-related → Activate `flight_booking`
- Hotel-related → Activate `hotel_reservation`
- Planning-related → Activate `itinerary_generation`
- Multiple topics → Activate relevant combination

## Usage Examples

**"Find me a flight to Paris"** → flight_booking
**"Book hotel in Tokyo"** → hotel_reservation
**"Create 5-day Rome itinerary"** → itinerary_generation
**"Plan Paris trip with flights and hotel"** → flight_booking + hotel_reservation + itinerary_generation
```

Example 3 (markdown):
```markdown
# E-Commerce Platform (Router)

## Sub-Skills
- product_catalog - Browse, search, filter products
- shopping_cart - Add/remove items, quantities
- checkout_payment - Process orders, payments
- order_management - Track orders, returns
- admin_tools - Inventory, analytics

## Routing
product/catalog/search → product_catalog
cart/basket/add/remove → shopping_cart
checkout/payment/billing → checkout_payment
order/track/return → order_management
admin/inventory/analytics → admin_tools
```

Example 4 (lua):
```lua
# Product Catalog

## When to Use
Product browsing, searching, filtering, recommendations.

## Quick Reference
- Search products: `search(query, filters)`
- Get details: `getProduct(id)`
- Filter: `filter(category, price, brand)`
...
```

Version: 1.0 Last Updated: 2026-01-11 Scope: Cross-platform AI skills for Claude, Gemini, OpenAI, and generic LLMs

An AI skill is a focused knowledge package that enhances an AI agent’s capabilities in a specific domain. Skills include:

Modern AI skills follow three core principles:

These standards apply to all platforms (Claude, Gemini, OpenAI, generic).

Format: Gerund form (verb + -ing)

Why: Clearly describes the activity or capability the skill provides.

Format: Third person, actionable, includes BOTH “what” and “when”

Why: Injected into system prompts; inconsistent POV causes discovery problems.

Why: Token efficiency is critical—unused context wastes capacity.

Example Transformation:

Required Sections (in order):

File Structure (Open Agent Skills Standard):

YAML Frontmatter (required for all platforms):

Official Standard: Agent Skills Best Practices

Official Standard: Grounding Best Practices

Grounding Enhancements:

Note: Grounding costs $14 per 1,000 queries (as of Jan 5, 2026).

Official Standard: Key Guidelines for Custom GPTs

Use Case: Documentation sites, internal wikis, non-LLM tools

Format: Standard markdown with minimal metadata

Best Practice: Focus on human readability over token economy

Modern AI skills leverage advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) patterns for optimal knowledge delivery.

Pattern: Multi-query, context-aware retrieval with agent orchestration

Implementation in Skills:

Why: Agent can navigate structure to find exactly what’s needed.

Pattern: Knowledge graph structures for complex reasoning

Use Case: Large codebases, interconnected concepts, architectural analysis

Benefits: Multi-hop reasoning, relationship exploration, complex queries

Pattern: Specialized agents for different knowledge domains

Use Case: Enterprise workflows, compliance requirements, multi-domain expertise

Pattern: Self-evaluation and refinement before finalizing responses

Benefits: Higher quality outputs, fewer errors, better adherence to standards

Pattern: Semantic search over embeddings for concept-based retrieval

Use Case: Large documentation sets, conceptual queries, similarity search

Use this rubric to assess AI skill quality on a 10-point scale.

Problem: Including everything about a topic instead of focusing on actionable knowledge.

Fix: Focus on what the user needs to do, not history or background.

Problem: Using “I” or “you” in metadata (breaks Claude discovery).

Fix: Always use third person in description field.

Problem: Redundant explanations, verbose phrasing, or filler content.

Fix: Use bullet points, remove filler, focus on distinctions.

Problem: Code examples that don’t compile or run.

Fix: Test all code examples, ensure they compile/run.

Problem: Description explains what but not when.

Fix: Always include “Use when…” or “Use for…” clause.

Problem: All references in one file or directory, no organization.

Fix: Organize by category, enable agent navigation.

Problem: Including deprecated APIs or old best practices.

Fix: Regularly update skills, include version info.

Model Context Protocol (MCP): Standardizes how agents access tools and data

Multi-Modal Skills: Beyond text (images, audio, video)

Skill Composition: Skills that reference other skills

Real-Time Grounding: Skills + live data sources

Federated Skill Repositories: Decentralized skill discovery

Document Maintenance:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (yaml):
```yaml
name: building-react-applications  # kebab-case, gerund form
description: Building modern React applications with hooks, routing, and state management
```

Example 2 (elixir):
```elixir
[What it does]. Use when [specific triggers/scenarios].
```

Example 3 (json):
```json
## Quick Reference
*30-second overview with most common patterns*

[Core content - 3,000-4,500 tokens]

## Extended Reference
*See references/api.md for complete API documentation*
```

Example 4 (sql):
```sql
React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
It was created by Facebook and is now maintained by Meta and the
open-source community. React uses a component-based architecture
where you build encapsulated components that manage their own state.
```

Complete guide to the Three-Stream GitHub Architecture pattern for handling large codebases and documentation.

The Three-Stream GitHub Architecture (also called C3.x Router Architecture) is a pattern for creating comprehensive AI skills from large projects with extensive documentation and codebases. Instead of scraping just the documentation or just the codebase, it combines three independent streams of knowledge into a unified skill with intelligent routing.

Version: v2.6.0 (Phases 1-5 Complete!)

Key Innovation: Each stream scrapes independently, then a router skill intelligently directs Claude to the right sub-skill based on the user’s question.

Purpose: Extract code structure, patterns, and implementation details from the GitHub repository

Output: output/project-code/SKILL.md + references

Purpose: Extract official documentation from the project website

Output: output/project-docs/SKILL.md + references

Purpose: Extract community knowledge, issues, discussions, and changelog from GitHub

Output: output/project-github/SKILL.md + references

After creating the three stream skills, generate a router skill that intelligently directs queries to the right sub-skill.

What the router does:

The generated router skill has this structure:

Result: project-complete.zip containing:

Each stream focuses on one knowledge domain:

Update any stream without affecting others:

Router analyzes user intent and routes to the right knowledge source(s).

Combines official docs + code reality + community insights for complete knowledge.

Only loads relevant sub-skill(s) for each question, not all knowledge at once.

Challenge: Official docs + 1M+ lines of code + 10K+ issues

Challenge: Private codebase + Confluence docs + JIRA issues

Challenge: Small codebase + great docs + active community

Create router_config.json to customize routing behavior:

For complex questions, route to multiple sub-skills:

Router can express confidence and route accordingly:

If question doesn’t match any sub-skill clearly:

Godot Engine Example (Three-Stream Architecture):

Cause: Sub-skill descriptions too similar or routing keywords overlap

Cause: User question doesn’t match any routing patterns

Cause: Router loading multiple sub-skills unnecessarily

Each sub-skill should have a distinct purpose:

Use clear, descriptive sub-skill names:

Choose keywords that clearly distinguish each sub-skill:

Update streams independently as needed:

Status: ✅ Production Ready (v2.6.0 - Three-Stream Architecture Complete!)
